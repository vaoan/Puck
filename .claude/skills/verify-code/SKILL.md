# Coverage — Full Quality Gate

## Description

Runs **every quality check** in the CI pipeline, fixes failures inline, and reports results. This is the "make everything green" command.

**Philosophy:** Fix the code, not the rules. Do not use `--no-verify`, `eslint-disable`, `@ts-ignore`, `test.skip`, or any other bypass unless there is a genuine, documented reason. Every exception must be justified at the end.

---

## Usage

```
/coverage [options]
```

Or natural language:

```
Run all quality checks
Make sure everything passes
Full coverage check
```

## Parameters

| Parameter    | Required | Description                                               |
| ------------ | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--fix`      | No       | Auto-fix failures (default behavior)                      |
| `--report`   | No       | Only report issues, don't fix                             |
| `--no-smoke` | No       | Skip smoke tests (requires `pnpm dev` + Supabase running) |
| `--no-build` | No       | Skip production build (saves ~2min)                       |

---

## Execution Order

Run checks fastest-first. Stop and fix each failure before proceeding.

```
Step 1 → Format          pnpm format:check       (fix: pnpm format)
Step 2 → Lint            pnpm lint               (fix: pnpm lint --fix, then manual)
Step 3 → TypeCheck       pnpm typecheck          (fix: manual)
Step 4 → Unit Tests      pnpm test               (fix: manual)
Step 5 → Coverage        pnpm test:coverage      (fix: write tests or adjust exclusions)
Step 6 → Build           pnpm build              (fix: manual)
Step 7 → Smoke Tests     pnpm smoke              (requires dev servers + Supabase)
```

## Steps (with Task Tracking)

### Step 1: Initialize Task List

Create a task list to track progress:

```
TodoWrite([
  { content: "Format check", status: "in_progress" },
  { content: "Lint check", status: "pending" },
  { content: "TypeScript check", status: "pending" },
  { content: "Unit tests", status: "pending" },
  { content: "Coverage thresholds", status: "pending" },
  { content: "Production build", status: "pending" },
  { content: "Smoke tests", status: "pending" },
  { content: "Report results", status: "pending" }
])
```

### Step 2: Format Check

```bash
pnpm format:check
```

**If failures:**

```bash
pnpm format
```

Then re-run `pnpm format:check` to confirm. Do NOT skip files.

### Step 3: Lint Check

```bash
pnpm lint
```

**If failures:**

1. First try auto-fix: `pnpm lint --fix`
2. Re-run `pnpm lint` to check remaining errors
3. For remaining errors — fix them manually in the source code
4. **Do NOT add `eslint-disable` comments** unless:
   - The rule genuinely doesn't apply (e.g., `no-node-access` in a test using `container.querySelector` for Radix data-slot selectors)
   - The rule conflicts with a required pattern (e.g., `vi.mock` must come before imports, violating `import/order`)
   - Document WHY in the disable comment

### Step 4: TypeScript Check

```bash
pnpm typecheck
```

**If failures:**

Fix TypeScript errors in the source files. Common issues:

- Missing type imports
- Incorrect generic parameters
- Type mismatches after refactoring

Do NOT use `@ts-ignore` or `@ts-expect-error` unless the type system genuinely cannot express the correct type (e.g., complex generics in third-party libraries). Document WHY.

### Step 5: Unit Tests

```bash
pnpm test
```

**If failures:**

1. Read the failure output to understand what's failing
2. Fix the source code or the test — whichever is actually wrong
3. Do NOT use `test.skip` or `describe.skip`
4. Re-run until all pass

### Step 6: Coverage Thresholds

```bash
pnpm test:coverage
```

This runs all app/package test suites with coverage enabled. Each workspace has 85% thresholds for statements, branches, functions, and lines.

**If failures:**

1. Check which workspace failed and which metric is below 85%
2. Write meaningful tests to cover the gap — see [Testing Rules](../../rules/testing.md)
3. If a file is legitimately untestable (type-only, re-export shim, complex RHF internal), add it to the workspace's `vitest.config.ts` coverage exclusions with a comment explaining WHY
4. Do NOT lower thresholds below 85%

### Step 7: Production Build

```bash
pnpm build
```

**If failures:**

Fix build errors. Common issues:

- Import errors (module not found after moving files)
- Server/Client component mismatches
- Missing environment variables

### Step 8: Smoke Tests (Optional)

**Requires:** All apps running (`pnpm dev`) and Supabase running.

```bash
pnpm smoke
```

**If not available** (servers not running), skip with a note in the report.

**If failures:**

1. Read the Playwright output
2. Fix the failing tests or the app code
3. Do NOT skip tests

## Fix Rules

### Absolutely No Skipping

| Pattern                 | Verdict  | Alternative                               |
| ----------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `eslint-disable`        | AVOID    | Fix the code. Use only with WHY comment.  |
| `@ts-ignore`            | AVOID    | Fix the types. Use only for library bugs. |
| `test.skip`             | NEVER    | Fix the test or delete it.                |
| `--no-verify`           | NEVER    | Fix the hook failure.                     |
| `passWithNoTests: true` | OK       | Already in configs, harmless.             |
| Coverage exclusion      | JUSTIFY  | Only for genuinely untestable files.      |
| `any` cast              | MINIMIZE | Use only at mock boundaries in tests.     |

### When Exceptions Are Acceptable

An exception is acceptable ONLY when:

1. The code is genuinely correct and the tool is wrong
2. You can explain WHY in one sentence
3. The explanation references a specific technical constraint

**Examples of acceptable exceptions:**

```typescript
// eslint-disable-next-line testing-library/no-node-access -- Radix data-slot has no accessible role
container.querySelector("[data-slot='tabs']");

// eslint-disable-next-line import/order -- vi.mock must be hoisted before the import it mocks
import { myFunction } from "./myModule";

/* eslint-disable react/display-name -- mock factory components in vi.mock */
```

**Examples of unacceptable exceptions:**

```typescript
// @ts-ignore  ← WHY? Fix the type.
// eslint-disable-next-line  ← No rule specified, no reason given
test.skip("flaky test", ...)  ← Fix it or delete it
```

## Report Format

After all checks complete, output a summary:

```markdown
## Quality Gate Report

| `tabs.test.tsx:44` | `eslint-disable testing-library/no-node-access` | Radix data-slot selector has no accessible role |
```

## Coverage Per Workspace

When checking coverage, verify each workspace individually:

| Workspace         | Command                       | Threshold |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------- | --------- |
| `apps/web`        | `pnpm test:coverage:admin`    | 85%       |
| `apps/auth`       | `pnpm test:coverage:auth`     | 85%       |
| `apps/web`        | `pnpm test:coverage:store`    | 85%       |
| `apps/web`        | `pnpm test:coverage:studio`   | 85%       |
| `apps/worker`     | `pnpm test:coverage:payments` | 85%       |
| `apps/web`        | N/A (passWithNoTests)         | —         |
| `apps/playground` | N/A (passWithNoTests)         | —         |
| `packages/shared` | Part of `pnpm test:coverage`  | 85%       |
| `packages/ui`     | Part of `pnpm test:coverage`  | 85%       |

## Examples

### Example 1: Full run

```
/coverage
```

Runs all 7 steps, fixes failures, reports results.

### Example 2: Quick check (no build/smoke)

```
/coverage --no-build --no-smoke
```

Runs format, lint, typecheck, tests, coverage only.

### Example 3: Report only

```
/coverage --report
```

Runs all checks but does not modify any files. Lists all failures for manual review.
